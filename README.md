## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Vuex.js](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - State manager
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Firestore database
- [Vue 3 Datepicker](https://vue3datepicker.com/) - Datepicker Vue component
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor

### What I learned

I learned a lot of things, such a data exchange with real database, implementing infinite scroll from Intersection Observer, validating time data and dynamic switching dark/light theme. It was a great experience and a pretty hard challenge.
